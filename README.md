# traffic light
Check 3 LEDs before use them on the next repo I am thinking about<br>
16x2 LCD connected to atmega8 mc<br>
It has got a twi extension pcf8574 so I need to start it before.<br>
And blinking 3 LEDs via twi extension will be next step after this streetligter<br>
Yes, this streetlighter.c swithes 3 LEDs on and off like a simple traffic lighte does.
